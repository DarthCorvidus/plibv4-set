plibv4/Set - A wrapper for an array int, float or string values that are unique.

Set servers as a small wrapper to an array and array_unique. There are three
implementation so far - SetInt, SetFloat and SetString, to circumvent PHP's
traditional leniency on types which may produce unwanted behavior for functions
such as array_unique.

Typical uses I had were database queries for which I wanted to have a set of
unique values for each or one column, in order not to have to do a separate
SELECT DISTINCT query on each column too.
